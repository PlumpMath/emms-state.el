** About

This package provides a minor mode (=emms-status-mode=) for displaying
description and playing time of the current track played by [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/][EMMS]] in the
mode line.  It is intended to be used as a substitution for
=emms-playing-time= and =emms-mode-line= modes.

There are 2 main differences between =emms-status-mode= and
=emms-playing-time= + =emms-mode-line= modes:

1. =emms-status-mode= displays an additional symbol (⏵/⏸/⏹ by default)
   to show if the current track is being played/paused/stopped.

2. If a track is more than an hour long, its playing time would be
   displayed in a form H:MM:SS instead of MM:SS.

For example, =emms-status-mode= will display a paused track like this:

: ⏸ 1:42:37(3:31:05) John Smith - My very long and boring song

While with =emms-playing-time= + =emms-mode-line= modes, it will be:

: John Smith - My very long and boring song 102:37/211:05

And of course the default displayed string may be customized (see
=emms-status-mode-line-string= variable).

** Installation

*** Automatic

**** MELPA

This package can be installed from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (with =M-x package-install= or
=M-x list-packages=).

The package can be installed using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]] like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(emms-status :fetcher github :repo "alezost/emms-status.el"))
#+END_SRC

*** Manual

For the manual installation, clone the repo, add the directory to
=load-path= and add an autoload for the minor mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emms-status-dir")
(autoload 'emms-status-mode "emms-status" nil t)
#+END_SRC

Simply =M-x emms-status-mode=, but make sure that =emms-mode-line= mode
